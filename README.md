1. Define the Scope and Objectives Predict future water demand for each Indian state. Assess required storage capacity to meet demand. Consider variables like population growth, climate patterns, rainfall, and industrial usage.
2. Collect District-Level Data for Tamil Nadu
Since you're narrowing the scope, you'll need district-wise data.

Essential Data Sources (Tamil Nadu Specific)
Rainfall Data (District-wise)

IMD (India Meteorological Department): Monthly/yearly rainfall.
TN State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA): Climate reports.
Water Consumption Data

TN Public Works Department (PWD): Water usage reports.
Census & TN Government Reports: Domestic & industrial water demand.
Reservoir & Groundwater Storage

TN Water Resources Department: Reservoir levels.
Central Ground Water Board (CGWB): Groundwater depletion trends.
Demographic & Industrial Growth

TN State Planning Commission: District-wise population & industrial expansion.
Agriculture Department Reports: Water usage by farmers.
3. Adjust the Model for Tamil Nadu
Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA/LSTM/XGBoost) on district-level data.
Use rainfall data to predict surface & groundwater availability.
Estimate storage needs based on growth in population & industry.
4. Model Implementation
Train separate models for each district (e.g., Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai).
Develop an API or dashboard to visualize results (e.g., map Tamil Nadu with water demand forecasts).
5. Why This Scope Works?
âœ… Easier Data Collection: Tamil Nadu has detailed district-wise reports.
âœ… Higher Accuracy: Regional models perform better than nationwide models.
âœ… Real-World Impact: Helps TN Govt & policymakers plan better.

Next Steps
Start collecting Tamil Nadu-specific datasets (Want help finding sources?).
Choose a forecasting model (LSTM for deep learning, ARIMA for simpler analysis).
Build a prototype (District-wise predictions via an API or dashboard).
Would you like sample datasets or model code to start with? ðŸš€

To collect district-level data for Tamil Nadu, you can utilize the following resources:

1. Rainfall Data (District-wise):

India Meteorological Department (IMD): Provides detailed rainfall data for Tamil Nadu. For instance, the IMD's Regional Meteorological Centre in Chennai offers daily and seasonal rainfall distributions for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. 
MAUSAM

Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TN SDMA): Offers climate reports and rainfall data specific to Tamil Nadu. Their platform, TN-SMART, provides daily rainfall data for various districts. 
TN SMART

2. Water Consumption Data:

Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD): Responsible for water usage reports and management. While specific datasets may not be readily available online, you can contact them directly for detailed reports. 
WRD.TN.GOV.IN

Census of India: Provides demographic data, including water usage statistics. The Census 2011 data includes information on household amenities, which can be useful for understanding water consumption patterns. 
DATA.GOV.IN

3. Reservoir & Groundwater Storage:

Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department: Offers information on reservoir levels and water resources management. Their website provides reports on current reservoir statuses and water audits. 
WRD.TN.GOV.IN

Central Ground Water Board (CGWB): Provides reports on groundwater resources and utilization. The CGWB's report on dynamic groundwater resources of Tamil Nadu offers insights into groundwater availability and extraction. 
CGWB.GOV.IN

4. Demographic & Industrial Growth:

Tamil Nadu State Planning Commission: Offers data on population and industrial expansion. While specific datasets may not be readily available online, you can contact them directly for detailed reports.

Agriculture Department Reports: Provides information on water usage by farmers. The OpenCity platform offers datasets on groundwater availability and utilization in Tamil Nadu, which can be useful for understanding agricultural water usage. 
OPEN CITY DATA

5. Additional Resources:

Open Government Data Portal Tamil Nadu: Offers various datasets, including those related to water resources and demographics. You can explore their portal for relevant data.

Master Data of Districts & More: Provides master data of districts, which can be useful for demographic analysis.
